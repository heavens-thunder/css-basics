    <p>The higher the specificity a CSS rule possesses, the greater the chance that the CSS rule<br>
        will win out over another rule. However, when viewed in the browser, the first CSS rule<br>
        (with the Impact font) wins out, as shown in Figure 2-29.<br>
        To determine why the first rule wins, determine the CSS rule’s specificity. Follow<br>
        Table 2-4 when trying to determine a CSS rule’s specificity.<br>
