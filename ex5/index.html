    <p>Before standards compliance was recommended, designers used the align attribute<br>
        with the img element to move images to the side with text wrapping. The W3C deprecated<br>
        align and now recommends using float instead.<br>
        You can use floats with elements other than images to shift an item left or right from<br>
        its original placement.<br>
        In Figure 2-34, the second image overlaps the paragraph referencing the first image.<br>
        This looks confusing and needs to be fixed. To work around that, use clear:<br>
         <em>CSS Cookbook</em>.</p>
    <img src="../images/21618.png" class="rightFloat" alt="cover" />
    <p>The clear property tells the paragraph to appear after the end of the image flow. At the<br>
        second img, the clear property pushes the image down to the first line after the previous<br>
        line ends. Instead of lining up with the second p element, the image waits for a new line<br>
        before showing up <em>CSS Cookbook</em>.</p>
